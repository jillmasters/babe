## What does it do?

Babe is a responsive web app for couples who want shared lives and separate bank accounts. Why would you use it?

- It's a radically simplified version of Splitwise/Venmo designed for two people, with a simple interface, that lets you add and manage bills, 'call it even', or settle up a debt. Everything can be done with just a few clicks, with easy customisability.
- Invoicing your partner feels so unromantic. So Babe abstracts away the finicky details, letting you keep track of your shared spending with less fuss about the details and no upfront requests for repayment.
