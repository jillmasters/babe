# Babe: Fast, unfussy bill-splitting for couples

Babe is an app for couples who want shared lives and sole bank accounts. It's a radically simplified version of Splitwise/Venmo designed for two people, with a simple interface, that lets you add bills, call it even, or settle up. Invoicing your partner feels so unromantic. Babe abstracts away the finicky details, and lets you keep track faster and with less fuss about the details and no upfront requests for repayment.

## Core functions

Users can see a simple balance of which person is owed money ("Elon gets £12") and can add new, customised bills (with the ability to reduce the bill by a specific amount before splitting, or split the bill proportionally using a slider) which adjust the balance based on which person paid. With one button, users can also wipe the remaining balance ('call it even' and forgive the debt, or, if the person who owes has paid, 'settle up').

## Stretch goals

Stretch goals: Connect to bank account/Paypal, add shortcut buttons for regular bills (rent, netflix, contraception, etc.)
