## Features

Babe is a radically simplified version of Splitwise/Venmo designed for two people.

- Invoicing your partner feels so unromantic. So Babe abstracts away the finicky details, letting you keep track of your shared spending with less fuss about the details and no upfront requests for repayment.
- It has a simple interface that lets you add and manage bills, settle up debts, or 'call it even' with your partner. Everything can be done with just a few clicks, with easy customisability.
